[introduction]
== Introduction

This documents describes the api of Clerk, an proxy to get information from the Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster.

Operations supported for now :

 - fetch a list of pods in your own namespace, optionally filtered on name of the application

[resources]

== Authorization
Clerk required a Authorization Bearer token that is the serviceAccount token your application is running in. An application
is then permitted to perform operations in its own namespace.

In order to get this token in a running application in your cluster you can read the file
``/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token``

=== Local testing

To test out clerk locally you need to fetch the token for the namespace you want to test against.


Run the following invocation to obtain the token:

``oc project $namespace && oc get sa default -o json | jq -r ".secrets[].name" | grep -v docker | xargs -i oc get secret {} -o json | jq --arg name "token" '.data[$name]' -r | base64 -d > /tmp/clerk-token``

Where $namespace is the name of the namespace you want to fetch pods in.

Then read ``/tmp/clerk-token`` in your local profile

== Resources

=== Pods
